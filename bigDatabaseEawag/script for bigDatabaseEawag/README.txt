HOW TO RUN THIS SCRIPT AND MAKE YOUR DATABASE:
 - important thing is to copy "mvc.db" into the folder with 102 pollutants folder. Our database will come into being as a part of this mvc.db. It will create 3 tables: "eawag_compounds", "eawag_reactions", "kegg_reactions" - the last one are our mapped eawag->kegg reactions with foreign keys to other 2 tables and table "reaction" originally in mvc.db

 - this script has to sit in that main folder too and run it with "python3 bigDatabaseEawag_v2.py"

 - in folder "bigDatabase + data" is already everything needed (with files generated by keggReact.py), but not the "mvc.db" (was too big), it won't work without it.


HOW IT WORKS:

First I tried to filter possible kegg reactions by the order of input/output kegg cmp. But with this approach I got only suspiciously small amount of kegg reactions. Then I decided to try filter it by E.C. number with the hope that "<=>" between reactants maybe doesn't specify the order of input/outputs. This way I got 407 mappings (369 distinct kegg reactions are flagged in "reactions" table in mvc). 5 kegg reactions weren't found in this table at all.


I decided it's quite impossible to flag every possible kegg reaction in table "reactions" in mvc by two different flags - one for reactions with compounds with cutoff 1.0 and the other one for reactions with cmps cutoff > 0.9. The problem is, that 1 kegg reaction can be connected with multiple eawag reactions, for example:

 - c1064 has bestHit C16473 with cutoff 1.0
 - c1074 has bestHit C16474 with cutoff 1.0
 ------ together -> eawag reaction r1207

 - c0296 has bestHit C16473 with cutoff 1.0
 - c0297 has bestHit C16474 with cutoff 1.0
 ------ together -> eawag reaction r0283

 - C16473 + C16474 = R08115 same for both eawag reactions

There can be cases, where 2 eawag reactions map to the same kegg reaction and one of them contains cmp with cutoff >=0.9, while the other reaction has only cmps cutoff 1.0. For these reasons there is only one column for flagging these kegg reactions.
