v3:
Script modified to flag rows in "chemical_species" table in mvc.db with 2 flags for 1.0/>=0.9 cutoff connection with some eawag compound. 

Run the script with command 'python3 bigDatabaseEawag_v3.py *args' where '*args' can be:
    - '-help': for printing options without doing anything else
    - 'smiles='Oc1ccccc1O' name bestHitKeggID is_in_reaction': where smiles must be always included and in addition you can write which columns do you want to print from:
	eawag_id, smiles, name, is_in_reaction, bestHitKeggID, cutoff, alternativeKeggID
    or none of them = it will print all columns from db
    - 'kegg=C05270': this will print the connection with eawag of your chosen cmp from chemical_species table and its cutoff (1.0 or >= 0.9)
    - 'kegg100' or 'kegg90': for printing all flagged cmps from table chemical_species into a csv file with date and time specifications
    
You can run the script without any *args, then the database will only be created.


v2:
HOW TO RUN THIS SCRIPT AND MAKE YOUR DATABASE:
 - important thing is to copy "mvc.db" into the folder with 102 pollutants folder. Our database will come into being as a part of this mvc.db. It will create 3 tables: "eawag_compounds", "eawag_reactions", "kegg_reactions" - the last one are our mapped eawag->kegg reactions with foreign keys to other 2 tables and table "reaction" originally in mvc.db

 - this script has to sit in that main folder too and run it with "python3 bigDatabaseEawag_v2.py"

 - in folder "bigDatabase + data" is already everything needed (with files generated by keggReact.py), but not the "mvc.db" (was too big), it won't work without it.


HOW IT WORKS:

First I tried to filter possible kegg reactions by the order of input/output kegg cmp. But with this approach I got only suspiciously small amount of kegg reactions. Then I decided to try filter it by E.C. number with the hope that "<=>" between reactants maybe doesn't specify the order of input/outputs. This way I got 407 mappings (369 distinct kegg reactions are flagged in "reactions" table in mvc). 5 kegg reactions weren't found in this table at all.


I decided it's quite impossible to flag every possible kegg reaction in table "reactions" in mvc by two different flags - one for reactions with compounds with cutoff 1.0 and the other one for reactions with cmps cutoff > 0.9. The problem is, that 1 kegg reaction can be connected with multiple eawag reactions, for example:

 - c1064 has bestHit C16473 with cutoff 1.0
 - c1074 has bestHit C16474 with cutoff 1.0
 ------ together -> eawag reaction r1207

 - c0296 has bestHit C16473 with cutoff 1.0
 - c0297 has bestHit C16474 with cutoff 1.0
 ------ together -> eawag reaction r0283

 - C16473 + C16474 = R08115 same for both eawag reactions

There can be cases, where 2 eawag reactions map to the same kegg reaction and one of them contains cmp with cutoff >=0.9, while the other reaction has only cmps cutoff 1.0. For these reasons there is only one column for flagging these kegg reactions.
