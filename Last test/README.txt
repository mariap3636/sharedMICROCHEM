Testing folder with complete information for 3 (problematic) pollutants.

The only missing thing is incorporating script addInfoSimcompWithHeader_v2.py into the bash_script.sh,
it is copied into each folder, but couldn't be launched in each iteration - for some reason this was impossible for me without critical errors in bash script, so I runned it in each folder by hand.

The other scripts and changes are already included in the bash script.

In each folder is file "longname.txt" with the full name of the pollutant.
